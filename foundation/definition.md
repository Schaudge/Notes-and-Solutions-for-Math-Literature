# Some Concepts

1. directed set  
A directed set $`I`$ is a set equipped with a binary relation ≤ that satisfies:  
(i) i ≤ i for all $`i ∈ I`$ (reflexive);  
(ii) if i ≤ j and j ≤ k, then i ≤ k (transitive);  
(iii) for any $`i, j ∈ I`$ there exists $`k ∈ I`$ with i, j ≤ k (upper bound property).  

3. nets  
Let $`X`$ be a topological space. A net in $`X`$ is a map $`x: I → X`$ where $`I`$ is a directed set. 
A net $`x: I → X`$ is usually denoted $`\{x_i, i∈I\}`$.
